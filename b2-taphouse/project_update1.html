  <h1>Project Update 1</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>I am making a new site for the Salem, Oregon business <a href="http://www.b2taphouse.com/">B<sup>2</sup> Taphouse</a>. The current site is pretty bad and in dire need of a make-over.</li>
    <li>My intended audience is people of drinking age. I have patroned the business and the demographic is quite wide. It's a very popular spot for people, young and old.</li>
    <li>My site would ideally be more functional and aesthetically pleasing than the current site. The business is already very popular, and I believe that a more polished site could attract even more business.</li>
    <li>I intend to keep the same content, but in a less chaotic format.</li>
    <li><ul>

          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Tap List</li>
          <li>Events</li>
          <li>b<sup>2</sup> Eats</li>
          <li>Contact</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I'm not sure how the taplist works at this point. It's a representation of what is on tap and how full each of the kegs are at any given point.</li>
